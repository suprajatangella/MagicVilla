Project Functionality:

Web API Functionality:
1. RESTful Web API Development:
   - Built using **C#** with **authentication** for secure access.
   - Handles all the back-end logic and database operations.

2. CRUD Operations:
   - The API supports **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations for managing villas and villa numbers.

Web Application Functionality:
1. Villa Home Page:
   - Displays a list of villas and their details by consuming data from the Web API.

2. Villa Screens:
   - Allows users to perform CRUD operations on villa data (e.g., adding a new villa, updating details, or deleting a villa).

3. Villa Number Screens:
   - Enables CRUD operations for villa numbers, such as assigning or managing villa numbers for each villa.

Integration:
- The web application communicates with the RESTful Web API to display and manage villa-related data seamlessly. 

This project focuses on integrating a secure API with a user-friendly web application to manage villa information efficiently.

Key Skills:
1. ASP.NET Core Web API Development:
   - Understanding the fundamentals of ASP.NET Core web APIs.
   - Building RESTful APIs in .NET 7.

2. API Documentation:
   - Documenting APIs using Swagger and Swashbuckle.

3. API Versioning:
   - Implementing version control for APIs.

4. Database Integration:
   - Using Entity Framework (EF) with Code-First Migrations.
   - Implementing the Repository Pattern for database interactions.

5. Security:
   - Adding Authentication and Authorization to APIs.

6. API Consumption:
   - Using HttpClient to consume APIs within the Repository Pattern.

Technologies:
1. Visual Studio 2022 (for development).
2. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) (for database management).
3. .NET 7 (framework).
4. Swagger/Swashbuckle (for API documentation).
5. Entity Framework (EF Core) (for database integration).
6. HttpClient (for API consumption).
